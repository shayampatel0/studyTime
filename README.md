# Study Time Plus 

Welcome to my app! This app was made for life beyond the bootcamp. 
StudyTime is a React Application that allows Users to select a time block from the hours of operation. Once a time slot is chosen, it becomes unavaible to other Users. 
The time blocks will be color coded to show if it is avaiable or taken.

## Functionality 
The first step to create this application was to structure its functionality to see how it could be designed visually. There are four key components to this application which I have listed below. 
1- User is able to book a time block from 8am to 5pm, in one hour blocks. They also select the subject they need tutoring in. 
2-User Authenication. The user can log in to save their info for returning customers. Otherwise they can just make a new entry on the calender. The card should request user to input email 
3- once the booking is made, images pertaining that subject will appear at the bottom on the page 
4-There will be an admin page with CRUD operations. So I can add/remove bookings or add subjects

### Practical Utilization 
As a private academic tutor, I have recently acquired over 10 children to tutor in various subjects. Due to the increase in the number of students, my time management skills have taken a hit. That is how StudyTimePlus came into fruition. STP allows Users to book a time block for a specific subject matter. Users can log in or sign-up.

#### Design 

The overall design is supposed to be minimalisitic with later upgrades coming in later versions.
